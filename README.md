MSYS2 variant

I make no guarantees whatsoever that this clone is correct.
Just took the VC variant and made it compile under MSYS2, so that DirectShow filters could be programmed without visual studio and vcc.

Also there is only a .cbp file and no make or cmake file. Take whatever info is needed out of those to create your own if need be.
